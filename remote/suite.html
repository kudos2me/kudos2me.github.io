                                    <p>I was the sole designer of <a href="http://www.thefullsuite.com/migrate/suitemoves">Suite Moves</a>, a tool enabling Full Suite customers to easily migrate locally stored documents to their cloud-based SharePoint Online sites, by themselves.</p>

                                    <h3>Process</h3>
                                    <hr class="star-primary"/>
                                    <p>I led an internal workshop to identify feature sets as part of a long-term vision for the product. All items listed were then further refined and classified (thorugh an affinity diagramming exercise) so that these product features were more manageable.</p>
                                    <p>4 core product features were derived from this exercise and they were further ranked by <strong>importance</strong> and <strong>feasibility</strong>, which was then plotted against a prioritisation chart. This chart gave us direction on what our team had to focus our efforts on.</p>
                                    <p>User stories and acivity flows were then mapped. This also lents itself to generating product requirements and key feature sets.</p>
                                    <p>I then created high-fidelity prototypes, complete with animation using a combination of PowerPoint and Expression Blend with Sketchflow. This provided a real-world view of the end product and was a great conversational piece to refine the product with other product team members. An advantge of using Expression Blend was the ability to reuse the animation code in the final production build.</p>
