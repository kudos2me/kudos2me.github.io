                                    <p>I was tasked with creating an interface for the official All Blacks app for the Windows Phone 7 mobile. The app retrieved news, fixtures and player content from an external XML data source. </p>

                                    <p>After sketching conceptual wireframes, I quickly developed lo-fi prototypes reflecting the app's UI  and transitions between each <em>card</em> using the Expression Blend tool.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>An advantage to prototyping Windows Phone 7 Apps is that the prototyping tool is baked into the same development environment used to create the final version. I used this project as an exercise to learn more about Sketchflow and Expression Blend.</p>
        
                                    <p>I worked closelye with our visual designer to provide direction on the capabilities with <strong>Windows Phone 7</strong> platform.</p>
                                    <p>With visual design approved, elements of the prototype's code base were easily translated into the final build. </p>    
                                    <p>I was also responsible for integrating the visuals, designed in Photoshop, with the backend code developed by our programmers.</p>  
                                    <p>I leverage this technical "know-how" of Silverlight by creating interfaces that meet user needs, business goals and are realistic to develop.</p>
