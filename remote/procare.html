                                    <p>I was tasked to redesign <a href="http://www.procare.co.nz">Procare's</a> existing the public website - a health care provider serving the Auckland region.</p>
                                    <p>Procare felt their website was not acting as a business tool but rather a brochure-ware page. The primary issue was that the call centre was getting inundated with phone calls that could've easily be served by the website. There simply was too much content for people to go through.</p>
                                    <h3>Process</h3>
                                    <hr class="star-primary"/>
                                    <p>To find out the real issue I felt the need to carry out some user research prior to making any bold steps. I carried out user surveys to 100 sample users to gain feedback on the previous state of the website and analysed data sourced from Google Analytics over a one year period focusing on average time spent and bounce rate.</p>
                                    <p>Comparison of wireframe to build User feedback and analytics data indicated a need to find doctors/medical centres. This became the core of the redesign for the website. Designed a custom search page that provided auto-complete hints against 3 criteria's enabling immediate user feedback. I also restructured website into 5 main sections by merging and removing content based on a content analysis.</p>
