                                    <p>I was responsible for designing a user interface for fund managers to track their mammoth portfolios. Fund managers would previously extract information from a spreadsheet, which was very time consuming and not cost effective.</p>
                                    <p>Fund managers needed rapid contextual information so they could make timely decisions. I designed a dashboard that catered towards this. Another objective was to <strong>humanise the relationship</strong> between the data and investors by using "everyday language" into the context of the dashboard.</p>
                                    <p>Part of this process involved mapping out the <strong>user pathways</strong> of how a fund manager would attain the information they needed. I did so through user interviews and contextual enquiry, before mapping out the experience. </p>          
                                    <p>Working with the visual designer, we came up with a look and feel that could be easily designed as a <strong>Silverlight</strong> application using native <strong>XAML</strong> code.</p>         
                                    <p>I also supplied the client with a visual style guide. This document identifies all the measurements and colours of each reusable component in the application. Future developers need only change the XAML using this guide (for cosmetic changes). </p>
