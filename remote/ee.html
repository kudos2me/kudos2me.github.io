                            <p>EE's primary objective for their online store was to provide a consistent experience across many platforms and devices. My task was to design <strong>high-fidelity prototypes</strong> for each device breakpoint during the design and development phase. Creating these prototypes were done in <strong>HTML5, CSS3 and javascript</strong></p>
                            
                            <h3>Process</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary"/>
                            <p>We aimed to meet 3 primary device breakpoints. They were:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Mobile (320 x 480 pixels)</li>
                                <li>Tablet (&lt; 768 pixels) </li>
                                <li>Desktop (&gt; 1024 x 768 pixels)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Early prototypes quickly identified capabilties of each device prior to production development, e.g. how video renders on each platform. This would be a constant evolution during the development phase. </p>
                            <p>High fidelity prototyping has major advantages over classical wireframes when dealing with <strong>responsive web design</strong>. It removes the need for constant documentation up until the final prototype has been approved. Users are able to see real world examples of how their design would render on a HTC Wildfire mobile device over Apple's Thunderbolt Cinema Display. It would also show the interactive nature and technical limitations of each device.</p>
                           <!--p>Seeing the design viewed on multiple devices raised key issues of <strong>hierarchical content</strong>, i.e. what content was relevant to the user at the time of using each device? The research conducted by the team to formulate <strong>customer journeys</strong> would assist in answering this, as well as meeting further discussions in aligning with the business goals.</p-->
