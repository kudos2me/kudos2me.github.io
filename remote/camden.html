                            <h3>Background</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary"/>
                            <p>I was the lead UX Developer on the rebranding project of team collaboration sites built on the SharePoint 2010 platform for over 6000 users. Primary objective was to create a system enabling users to store, manage and find their documents quickly and with ease.</p>

                            <h3>Process</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary"/>
                            <p>I began the project by holding workshops and conducted user interviews with groups of 8 to 10 people of varying degrees in the organisation. These groups would help define a fixed set of internal labels used for tagging their documents. With these terms, I designed a taxonomy-driven navigation where users were required to tag all files uploaded into the system. This would also aid with faceted searches. </p>
                            
                            <p>Having defined the functional specificaions, I then produced wireframes and HTML prototypes for product owners and backend developers to illustrate complex user interactions, thus eliminating unnecessary development time by building it "right first time"</p>
                                
                            <p>A key requirement was to implement a custom look and feel that had to align with asthetics of the corporate intranet. With the intranet as a visual cue, I designed a corporate skin for our system using PhotoShop. </p>
                                
                            <p>As part of our development methodology, I also encouraged the adoption of <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a>, an online kanban tool used to create user stories and conducted product backlog grooming session with product owner. This meant transparency and accountability amongst all team members for rapid changes.</p>
