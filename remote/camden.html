                            <h3>Process</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary"/>
                            <p>The 3 primary devices we were aiming towards were mobile (320 x 480 pixels), tablet (&lt; 768 pixels) and desktop (&gt; 1024 x 768 pixels). Early prototypes identified what specific devices were capable of doing for example, how video would render across all platfroms. This would continue to evolve over the development phase. </p>
                            <p>High fidelity prototyping has major advantages over classical wireframes when dealing with <strong>responsive web design</strong>. It removes the need for constant documentation up until the final prototype has been approved. Users are able to see real world examples of how their design would render on a HTC Wildfire mobile device over Apple's Thunderbolt Cinema Display. It would also show the interactive nature and technical limitations of each device.</p>
                           <p>Seeing the design viewed on multiple devices raised key issues of <strong>hierarchical content</strong>, i.e. what content was relevant to the user at the time of using each device? The research conducted by the team to formulate <strong>customer journeys</strong> would assist in answering this, as well as meeting further discussions in aligning with the business goals.</p>
